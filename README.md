# NLP_with_Disaster_Tweets

This is a repository for my Kaggle competition on Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Competition Description

Twitter has become a crucial communication channel during times of emergency. The widespread use of smartphones enables individuals to report emergencies in real-time. Consequently, various agencies, including disaster relief organizations and news agencies, are keen on programmatically monitoring Twitter for such information.

However, distinguishing whether a person's words genuinely indicate a disaster is not always straightforward. Consider the following example:

In this example, the author explicitly uses the word "ABLAZE" but means it metaphorically. While this may be clear to a human, especially with visual context, it may not be as apparent to a machine.

In this competition, my challenge is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting which tweets are related to real disasters and which ones are not. The dataset provided consists of 10,000 tweets that have been manually classified. If you are new to Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, a quick tutorial has been created to help you get started.

**Disclaimer:** The dataset for this competition contains text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive.
